Use bonemeal to spread small flowers. This is a port of the Bedrock Edition mechanic of [Flower Farming](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Flower_farming).

## Configuration
The configuration file is located at `.minecraft/config/flourish.json`. It can also be edited through in-game UI (using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) on Fabric and Quilt).

### Default Config File
```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "wither_rose": false, 
    "torchflower": false,
    "use_tall_flower_behavior": false
}
```

### Config Option Descriptions
- `wither_rose`: When true, allows wither roses to be spread.
- `use_tall_flower_behavior`: Previously, this mod made it so that bonemealing a small flower would spawn a small flower item just like it does for tall flowers. When true, this config replaces the Bedrock Edition mechanic with this mechanic. [YouTube Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/SebkrRJZ-GU)
